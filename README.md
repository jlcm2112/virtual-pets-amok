##Welcome to the new-and-improved Virtual Pet Shelter!

The pets were running amok -- so we organized them. This shelter currently handles organic cats and dogs and robotic cats and dogs.

-Robotic pets need to be maintained (don't let their oil level get below 10 or it will affect their health).

-All dogs need to be walked 

-Organic dogs need to have their cages cleaned (messiness >= 100 will negatively affect their health)

-Organic cats share a Litterbox which starts at a messiness level of 50. If it goes above 100, it overflows, negatively affecting all of their health.

-All pets will get bored if you don't play with them.

You can admit or adopt a new pet at any time, just make sure you take good care of them!
